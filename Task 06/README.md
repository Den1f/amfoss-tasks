**Experience:**

So this the app that I created using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkNiMBhCxARIsAIDDKNXZwe8x406qIuxcPBgY3SBnbrs_epTA7I14I9q3qz6kmBYvdmDO4GEaAq5XEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkNiMBhCxARIsAIDDKNU5Ur7V7p90z9LnycPgB4Ogb58gUnUtcvN8K9ptiMTHGJ5MkbnBV0IaAnwyEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). It was fun actually. I would love to learn more about flutter and android studio and work on this app development field.  

**Sample UI:**

This is the [sample UI](https://github.com/amfoss/tasks/tree/main/task-6) that I used to design this app which was provided in the task document.
