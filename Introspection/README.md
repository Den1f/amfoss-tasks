# A. WHY MUST WE CHOOSE YOU?
I AM QUITE EXCITED ABOUT JOINING THIS WONDERFUL CLUB WHICH WILL SURELY FILL MY VOID OF INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE WITH SOME GREAT LEARNING.
AS THE MOTTO OF THE CLUB ITSELF IS ‘LEARNING  TO LEARN’, I HOPE WORKING FOR THIS CLUB
WILL REALLY BRING ME CLOSER TO A BETTER WAY OF APPROACHING NEW THINGS IN LIFE.

# B. WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
AS I’M IN THE BEST ENGINEERING COLLEGE I WOULD SURELY TRY TO UPGRADE MYSELF TO STAND OUT OF THE CROWD, 
LIKE LEARNING A NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE OR LEARNING SOMETHING NEW THAT WOULD PROBABLY HELP ME 
PAVE MY PATH AND EVOLVE MYSELF AS AN ACCOMPLISHED ENGINEER. 

# C. HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I AM AWARE OF MY POTENTIALS AND I BELIEVE IF THE CLUB PROVIDES ME PROPER GUIDANCE, I CAN WORK HARD.
I AM READY TO PUT MY BEST EFFORT OUT THERE.

# D. DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK FOR THE SELECTION PROCESS?
NO, IT IS MORE THAN PERFECT. IT WILL HELP ME LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT FIELDS AND GAIN A HUGE AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE, WHICH IS REALLY HELPFUL.
