# Setup a Simple Personal Website
I couldn't forget about this task ever. It took me more than a week to atleast deploy my webpage successfully and it was really a headache as i was working on this task daily for about 3 to 5 hours just to figure out where i am going wrong and i literally did the whole process from the start repeateadly, as my website was getting crashed whenever i try to push it into my github repo. 
But that satisfaction after it was done finally, was like getting your code accecpted at once without any single error.
